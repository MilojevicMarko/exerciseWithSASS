          <p>Don’t fill your page up with ‘stuff’. White space is good – it enhances the look of your site. Try to keep your content as the focus of your site. Use fonts that will be available on all computers so your page doesn’t end up looking messy.</p>

            <p>Site navigation plays a huge role in determining how long visitors stay and explore your site. If you have an easy to use navigation system, you’ll keep your visitors around longer.
